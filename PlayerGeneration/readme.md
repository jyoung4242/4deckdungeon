# Player Generation – Card-Based RPG

This document explains the **player generation system** for the Card-Based RPG. Players are created entirely from a **deck of cards**,
which determines their backstory, class, race, skills, and perks.

---

## 1. Overview

- **Maximum Players:** 4
- **Deck Usage:** All players draw from a single common deck.
- **Cards Kept:** Each card drawn during generation is kept by the player and cannot be drawn by others.
- **Card Distribution:** Each player receives **13 cards** during generation.

**Card Breakdown:**

| Cards | Purpose                                                                    |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Backstory & Suit Affinity                                                  |
| 2-5   | Core Traits / Perks                                                        |
| 6-10  | Skills (e.g., Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Perception, Stealth, Magic) |
| 11-13 | Optional Traits, Flaws, or Additional Skills                               |

## 2. Card 1 – Backstory & Suit Affinity

- **Suit determines affinity**:

  - Aligned → bonus to related checks
  - Opposite → minor constraints or penalties

- **Rank may determine core trait strength**.

- **Backstory Example:**

  - Orphaned Wanderer → survival, stealth, tracking
  - Noble Scout → diplomacy, tactics, ranged combat

- Campaigns can predefine **backstory options and perk pools**.

---

## 3. Cards 2–5 – Core Traits / Perks

- Draw **4 cards** from 2–A.
- Each card represents a **core perk**, which can **stack** if duplicates are drawn.
- Examples of perks: Tracking, Archery Mastery, Stealth, Diplomacy.
- **Perk strength** may scale with **card rank** (2–A → low to high).

---

## 4. Cards 6–10 – Skills

- Each card maps to a **core skill**:

  - Strength
  - Agility
  - Intelligence
  - Perception
  - Stealth
  - Magic

- **Card rank** determines skill value relative to base.
- Skills **do not automatically improve**; progression occurs via **XP earned during gameplay**.

---

## 5. Cards 11–13 – Traits / Flaws

- Optional **additional character traits or minor flaws**.
- Can modify skill checks or narrative interactions.
- Examples: Night Vision, Claustrophobic, Quick Healer.

---

## 6. Affinity Alignment

- Each character has a **primary suit affinity** based on Card 1.
- Affects **narrative checks and engagements**:
  - Aligned → +1 to checks
  - Opposite → -1 to checks
  - Neutral → no modifier

---

## 7. Character Sheet Summary

After generation, players should have:

- **Backstory**
- **Class & Race**
- **Skills with base values**
- **Perks & Traits**
- **Suit Affinity**

> All of this is summarized in the **Player Character Sheet** for easy reference during play.

---

## 8. GM Guidance

- GMs may **predefine backstories, classes, races, and perk pools** for their campaign.
- Backstories can **map to specific perk pools**, with some overlap allowed for variety.
- Card draws are **used as a randomizing mechanic**, but GMs can provide **guidance or optional combinations** for more narrative
  variety.

---

## 9. Notes

- Duplicate cards **stack effects** rather than being ignored.
- Player generation is **modular**, allowing campaign-specific customization.
- All randomness comes from the **deck draw**, making the system portable for tabletop or digital implementations.

### Example Player Generation Flow:

1. Shuffle deck.
2. Deal **13 cards** to each player.
3. Assign **Card 1 → Backstory & Affinity**.
4. Assign **Cards 2–5 → Perks/Traits**.
5. Assign **Cards 6–10 → Skills**.
6. Assign **Cards 11–13 → Optional Traits/Flaws**.
