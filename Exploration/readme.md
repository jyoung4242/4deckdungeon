# Exploration / Discovery Encounter

Exploration encounters represent moments of discovery, navigation, environmental interaction, and world-building. These encounters are
typically non-combat and are used to reveal locations, lore, resources, secrets, or paths forward in the campaign.

Exploration encounters are driven primarily by Scene Metadata defined by the GM, with controlled randomness layered on through deck
draws.

## Purpose

Exploration encounters are used to:

- Discover new locations or areas
- Reveal hidden paths, shortcuts, or hazards
- Uncover lore, clues, or world history
- Acquire non-combat resources
- Progress exploration-based objectives
- Create tension through uncertainty rather than combat

They emphasize player choice and interpretation over success/failure states.

## GM Authorship vs Randomization

Exploration encounters are semi-authored:

- The GM defines what can be discovered in a scene
- The deck determines how discovery unfolds
- Randomness influences quality, risk, or depth, not narrative validity

Exploration should rarely block progression outright.

## Scene Metadata

Each scene defines Exploration Metadata, which determines how the deck is interpreted.

Typical metadata fields include:

### Exploration Theme

Ruins, wilderness, urban, arcane, underground, alien, etc.

### Discovery Pools

- Locations
- Lore entries
- Environmental features
- Resources
- Hidden threats or hazards

### Risk Level

Low / Moderate / High

Influences consequences of poor draws

### Available Contest Hooks

Optional contests tied to navigation, perception, survival, or intellect

### Reveal Limits

- Maximum discoveries allowed in the scene
- Whether exploration can be repeated

## Draw Structure

Exploration encounters typically use 1–3 card draws, depending on scene scale.

### Standard Exploration Draw

#### Primary Draw

Determines the category or focus of discovery

#### Optional Secondary Draw

Determines quality, depth, or complication

#### Optional Tension Draw

Introduced if the scene has elevated risk

## Card Interpretation

### Suits — Discovery Type

| Suit     | Discovery Focus                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Hearts   | Lore, history, NPC traces, emotional narrative |
| Diamonds | Resources, valuables, crafting materials       |
| Clubs    | Environment, terrain, physical structures      |
| Spades   | Danger, hidden threats, ominous signs          |

### Ranks — Depth or Impact

| Rank Range | Interpretation                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 2–5        | Surface-level discovery                     |
| 6–9        | Useful or meaningful discovery              |
| 10–Jack    | Significant insight or advantage            |
| Queen–King | Major revelation or scene-altering find     |
| Ace        | Rare, unique, or campaign-shaping discovery |

### Jokers

Jokers represent unexpected shifts in exploration.

- A positive twist (hidden sanctuary, forgotten shortcut)
- A negative twist (collapse, ambush trigger, cursed relic)
- A reframing event that changes the scene's meaning

The GM decides the nature of the twist based on scene context.

## Optional Exploration Contests

Exploration encounters may introduce optional contests to deepen engagement.

Examples include:

- Navigating dangerous terrain
- Deciphering ancient markings
- Tracking elusive paths
- Avoiding environmental hazards

Winning a contest may:

- Improve the discovery's outcome
- Reveal additional information
- Avoid negative consequences

Failing a contest may:

- Introduce tension
- Trigger hazards
- Consume time or resources

Exploration contests enhance discovery but do not invalidate it.

## Failure & Consequences

Exploration does not usually fail outright.

Instead, poor draws or failed contests may result in:

- Partial information
- Misleading clues
- Resource loss
- Time pressure
- Environmental complications

The world remains discoverable, but at a cost.

## Progression & Replay

Exploration encounters may be:

- **One-time** (unique ruins, singular events)
- **Persistent** (regions revisited over time)
- **Layered** (new discoveries unlock after story progression)

Scene metadata defines replay conditions.

## Integration with Other Systems

Exploration encounters can lead directly into:

- Combat encounters (ambushes, lairs)
- Trap encounters (environmental hazards)
- NPC encounters (inhabitants, travelers)
- Quest progression
- Item discovery

They serve as connective tissue between systems.

## Design Philosophy

Exploration encounters prioritize:

- Discovery over danger
- Narrative richness over mechanics
- GM-authored intent with player-driven outcomes
- Controlled randomness to inspire, not derail

They are the primary tool for making the world feel alive.
