# Player Generation – Card-Based RPG

This document explains the player generation system for the Card-Based RPG. Characters are created entirely through a deck of cards,
which determines their backstory, class, race, skills, perks, and motivations. A total of 13 cards are used to fully generate a
character.

Character stories are created using a 4-card draw, producing a complete narrative identity without assigning any mechanical statistics.

The character’s quantitative attributes are then created by drawing the next 5 cards, representing traits such as Strength, Perception,
and other core capabilities.

Finally, from a skill pool generated by the character’s narrative, 4 skills are drawn to define the character’s practical competencies.

    The twist with this system is that all 4 players will draw from a common deck and keep the cards, ensuring a unique and vivid party experience.

---

## 1. Overview

- **Maximum Players:** 4
- **Deck Usage:** All players draw from a single common deck.
- **Cards Kept:** Each card drawn during generation is kept by the player and cannot be drawn by others.
- **Card Distribution:** Each player draws **4 cards** for core identity, then additional cards for skills and traits.

---

## 2. First 4 Cards – Core Character Identity

The first four cards define a character’s **narrative identity**. These cards do not assign numerical stats. Instead, they determine
**story context**, **motivations**, and **which perks and skills may later enter the character’s perk pool**.

Campaign designers define the available options and interpretations in campaign data.

| Card       | Purpose                | How to Interpret                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Notes                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Card 1** | **Backstory**          | **Rank** selects a backstory archetype (e.g., Orphan, Noble, Outcast, Scholar). **Suit** colors how that past was lived (Hearts → personal ties, Clubs → survival, Diamonds → trade/craft, Spades → hardship/conflict). | Backstories unlock themed perk pools and narrative hooks. Some perks may overlap across backstories. |
| **Card 2** | **Motivation / Drive** | **Rank** determines the character’s primary motivation (Revenge, Discovery, Duty, Redemption, Power, Survival, etc.). **Suit** expresses how that motivation manifests (idealistic, ruthless, pragmatic, obsessive).    | Motivation influences story hooks, engagement bonuses, and perk weighting.                           |
| **Card 3** | **Class / Archetype**  | **Rank** selects the class or archetype from the campaign’s class list. **Suit** defines **Class Expression / Playstyle Bias** (e.g., aggressive, tactical, supportive, unconventional).                                | Class does not grant stats—it determines access to perk and skill themes.                            |
| **Card 4** | **Race / Species**     | **Rank** selects race or species. **Suit** adds cultural, biological, or societal flavor (e.g., insular, nomadic, martial, scholarly).                                                                                  | Races may modify perk availability and narrative interactions.                                       |

- These cards do not grant numerical bonuses
- Their primary role is to:
  - Shape perk pools
  - Influence engagement outcomes
  - Seed story hooks
- GMs and campaign designers can:
  - Redefine meanings per campaign
  - Restrict or expand available options
  - Remap ranks/suits without changing system rules

## 3. Skills – Cards 5–9

Cards **5 through 9** represent the character’s **quantitative skill values**. These five cards define a character’s **core
capabilities** and are used when resolving checks, contests, and engagements throughout the game.

Each skill is assigned a **numerical value** based on the rank of its corresponding card. Face cards follow the standard progression:

- J = 11
- Q = 12
- K = 13
- A = 14 (or campaign-defined cap)

Suit has **no inherent effect** on skill values unless modified by perks, items, or campaign rules.

### Core Skills

---

### 1. Strength

Strength represents a character’s ability to apply **physical power** and overcome resistance through force.

Strength is used for:

- Breaking objects or barriers
- Grappling, shoving, and overpowering enemies
- Heavy melee combat
- Carrying, lifting, and endurance-based labor

In combat contests, Strength commonly influences:

- Damage potential
- Ability to overpower defenses
- Certain weapon effectiveness

Strength does not automatically imply size or aggression; narrative context is defined by earlier story cards.

---

### 2. Agility

Agility measures a character’s **speed, coordination, and precision of movement**.

Agility is used for:

- Dodging, parrying, and evasion
- Stealth and quiet movement
- Ranged combat accuracy
- Reflex-based actions and initiative modifiers

In contests, Agility often determines:

- Defensive success
- Reaction advantage
- Turn-order or engagement bonuses

Agility applies equally to combat, exploration, and social movement (e.g., slipping away unnoticed).

---

### 3. Intelligence

Intelligence governs **reasoning, knowledge, and mental adaptability**.

Intelligence is used for:

- Solving puzzles and deciphering clues
- Magical theory and spellcasting
- Tactical planning and analysis
- Academic, arcane, or technical knowledge checks

Intelligence may:

- Unlock advanced perks or spell trees
- Modify how characters interact with magical systems
- Influence learning speed or mastery progression

Intelligence is not a measure of common sense or emotional awareness unless defined by perks.

---

### 4. Perception

Perception measures **awareness of the environment** and the ability to detect subtle details.

Perception is used for:

- Spotting traps, ambushes, and hidden objects
- Tracking creatures or following trails
- Reading environmental cues
- Vision-based checks (darkness, fog, concealment)

Perception frequently interacts with:

- Engagement triggers
- Environmental storytelling
- Surprise mechanics during encounters

High Perception increases narrative clarity rather than raw power.

---

### 5. Constitution

Constitution represents a character’s **physical resilience and survivability**.

Constitution is used for:

- Health and stamina thresholds
- Resistance to poison, disease, and fatigue
- Endurance over long encounters
- Recovery and regeneration mechanics

In contests, Constitution may:

- Reduce incoming damage
- Extend survival in prolonged conflicts
- Influence resistance-based outcomes

Constitution does not prevent injury; it determines how well a character endures it.

---

### Design Notes

- Skill values are **static after character creation**
- Progression occurs through **perks, skills, items, and story outcomes**, not by increasing core skill numbers
- Skills act as the **baseline modifier** for checks; situational bonuses are layered on top

---

## 4. Affinity Alignment

Affinity represents a character’s **innate narrative alignment** and thematic strengths. It is not a skill or stat, but a **contextual
modifier** that influences how characters perform during checks, contests, and engagements.

### Determining Affinity

- The **suit of Card 1 (Backstory)** sets the character’s **Primary Affinity Suit**
- This affinity reflects how the character approaches challenges based on their life experience
- Affinity is fixed at character creation

---

### Suit Meanings (Default Campaign Mapping)

Campaigns may redefine these meanings, but the following serves as the default interpretation:

| Suit         | Affinity Theme      | Narrative Expression                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hearts**   | Empathy / Resolve   | Emotional strength, bonds, morale, protection, compassion                  |
| **Clubs**    | Instinct / Survival | Adaptability, cunning, grit, improvisation, raw endurance                  |
| **Diamonds** | Craft / Ingenuity   | Trade, intellect applied practically, preparation, wealth, tools, planning |
| **Spades**   | Conflict / Hardship | Warfare, struggle, sacrifice, endurance through adversity, discipline      |

---

### Affinity in Checks & Contests

Affinity modifies outcomes **only when relevant** to the situation:

- **Aligned Suit**  
  → **+1** to the check or contest outcome

- **Opposite Suit**  
  → **–1** to the check or contest outcome

- **Neutral Suit**  
  → No modifier

The GM (or game engine) determines relevance based on narrative context and action type.

---

### Opposing Suits

Opposite suits follow traditional card pairings:

- **Hearts ↔ Spades**
- **Clubs ↔ Diamonds**

Opposition represents thematic friction rather than direct weakness.

---

### When Affinity Applies

Affinity commonly applies during:

- Engagement draws (surprise, initiative, narrative advantage)
- Contests where approach or mindset matters
- Story-driven challenges tied to character history
- Certain perk or item interactions

Affinity **does not replace skill checks**; it subtly tilts outcomes in narratively appropriate situations.

---

### Design Intent

- Affinity is **lightweight and narrative-first**
- It rewards thematic play without requiring bookkeeping
- It allows campaign designers to influence tone without rewriting mechanics

Affinity should feel like a **story advantage**, not a mechanical burden.

---

## 5. Perk Selection (Cards 10–13)

- The final four cards are drawn from the **campaign-defined perk pool**, which is influenced by:

  - **Backstory** (Card 1)
  - **Motivation** (Card 2)
  - **Class** (Card 3)
  - **Race** (Card 4)

- Perk draws may produce **duplicates**:

  - If a duplicate is drawn, the perk **stacks** (increases in effectiveness or grants additional minor effect)
  - Maximum stacks and effects are defined in the [**Perks README**](../Perks/readme.md)

- The drawn perks become the character’s progression system, shaping playstyle and story interactions.

---

## 6. Player Character Sheet Summary

After generation, each character should have:

- **Backstory** (Card 1)
- **Class** (Card 2)
- **Race** (Card 3)
- **Purpose / Motivation** (Card 4)
- **Skills with base values**
- **Perks & Traits**
- **Suit Affinity**

---

## 7. GM Guidance

- Predefine backstories, classes, races, and purpose/motivation options per campaign.
- Map backstories and motivations to **perk pools**, with optional overlap for variety.
- Provide **guidance for interpreting suits and ranks** to flavor the character narrative.

---

## 8. Player Generation Flow

1. Shuffle deck.
2. Deal **4 cards** to each player (Card 1 → Backstory, Card 2 → Class, Card 3 → Race, Card 4 → Purpose/Motivation).
3. Assign additional cards for **skills and optional traits/flaws**.
4. Apply suit-based **affinity modifiers**.
5. Record all values on the **Player Character Sheet**.

---

This system ensures **unique, randomized, and narrative-driven characters** for every game session.
