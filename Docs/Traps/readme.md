## Trap Engagements

Trap encounters represent environmental dangers such as pressure plates, alarms, collapsing floors, poison darts, magical wards, or
timed mechanisms. Like combat, traps are resolved through structured card draws from the **Engagement Deck**, without dice.

Trap encounters may be **hidden or obvious**, **single-use or persistent**, and may escalate or chain into other engagements.

---

## Trap Encounter Flow

A trap encounter is resolved in up to **four phases**:

1. Trigger
2. Primary Draw (Trap Severity & Initiative)
3. Secondary Draw (Trap Complexity)
4. Resolution Draws (Player vs Trap Contests)

---

## 1. Trigger

The GM defines trap triggers during campaign or scene design.

**Common Triggers**

- Entering a tile or room
- Opening a door or container
- Interacting with an object
- Failing or succeeding another contest
- Timed or ambient effects

Triggers may include **metadata** that constrains the trap:

- Allowed trap types
- Whether the trap is hidden
- Whether detection is possible
- Whether failure escalates into combat or alerts enemies

---

## 2. Primary Draw – Trap Severity & Surprise

Draw **1 card** from the Engagement Deck.

### Suit – Affinity & Surprise

Compare the trap’s suit to the **party or acting character’s affinity**:

- **Aligned Suit**
  - Player gains advantage (early warning, slowed trigger, bonus on first contest)
- **Neutral Suit**
  - No modifier
- **Opposite Suit**
  - Player is surprised or disadvantaged
  - Trap may trigger immediately or gain a bonus

### Rank – Trap Severity (Relative to Party Level)

| Rank Range | Trap Severity | Description                              |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2–7        | Mild          | Annoyance, resource tax, minor damage    |
| 8–10       | Moderate      | Meaningful danger, conditions, alarms    |
| J–Q        | Severe        | High damage, multiple stages, escalation |
| K–A        | Critical      | Lethal, complex, cascading consequences  |

Severity is interpreted **relative to party level**, not absolute.

---

## 3. Secondary Draw – Trap Complexity

Draw **1 card**.

### Rank – Complexity Tier

| Rank Range | Complexity | Meaning                             |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 2–6        | Simple     | Single contest to resolve           |
| 7–10       | Multi-Step | Multiple checks or stages           |
| J–Q        | Layered    | Detection + disarm + consequence    |
| K–A        | Engineered | Persistent, timed, or reactive trap |

### Suit – Trap Category

Each scene defines what suits map to which trap families. Example default mapping:

| Suit     | Trap Type Examples                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Hearts   | Social / Alarm / Moral (alerts guards, hostage harm) |
| Diamonds | Mechanical (locks, gears, pressure plates)           |
| Clubs    | Environmental (fire, poison gas, collapsing terrain) |
| Spades   | Arcane / Beast / Natural (runes, roots, creatures)   |

---

## 4. Resolution – Trap Contests

Trap resolution uses the **Contest System**, treating the trap as an opposing entity.

### Trap Attributes

A trap may define:

- Detection Difficulty
- Disarm Difficulty
- Trigger Difficulty
- Damage / Effect Profile
- Escalation Rules

These values are derived from:

- Primary Draw Severity
- Secondary Draw Complexity
- Scene metadata

---

### Contest Examples

- **Detection Contest**

  - Skill: Perception, Intelligence
  - Failure may immediately trigger the trap

- **Disarm Contest**

  - Skill: Agility, Intelligence, specialized perks
  - Failure may partially trigger or escalate

- **Endurance Contest**
  - Skill: Constitution
  - Used to resist poison, damage, or conditions

Each contest is resolved via **card vs card** comparison:

- Player draws 1 card + modifiers
- Trap draws 1 card (severity-based bonus)

---

## Trap Outcomes

Trap encounters may result in:

- Successful avoidance
- Partial success with consequences
- Full trigger (damage, conditions, alerts)
- Escalation into:
  - Combat encounter
  - Alarmed NPC response
  - Environmental collapse
  - Timed follow-up trap

---

## XP & Progression

On successful resolution:

- Associated skills gain XP based on trap severity
- Perks related to detection, disarming, or resistance may advance

Failures still grant reduced XP, encouraging risk-taking.

---

## Example Trap Encounter

**Trigger:** Player opens a sealed vault door  
**Primary Draw:** Spades – Queen

- Severe arcane trap
- Affinity misaligned → disadvantage

**Secondary Draw:** Diamonds – 9

- Mechanical + Arcane layered trap

**Resolution:**

1. Detection contest (fail)
2. Trap partially triggers: arcane seal lashes out
3. Disarm contest under pressure
4. Failure escalates → alarm engagement triggered

---

## Design Notes

- Traps are not binary pass/fail; they are encounters.
- Multiple players may assist during trap contests.
- Scene metadata limits trap types to maintain narrative coherence.
- Trap rules intentionally mirror combat to reduce cognitive load.
