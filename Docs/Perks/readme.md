# Perks

Traits, flaws, and perks represent **specific advantages, drawbacks, or tendencies** that emerge from a character’s background and
experiences. These elements provide mechanical nuance and narrative hooks without altering core skill values.

Traits and perks are primarily sourced from the character’s **narrative identity** (Cards 1–4).

---

### Perk Sources

Each portion of player generation contributes to a **perk pool**. Players do not automatically gain all perks from a source; instead,
these sources define **which perks may be drawn or unlocked**.

---

### 1. Backstory-Based Perks (Card 1)

Backstory perks reflect learned behaviors, lived hardship, or formative experiences.

**Example Perks:**

- _Streetwise_ — Bonus when navigating cities, black markets, or criminal contacts
- _Hardened_ — Reduced penalties from fear, intimidation, or stress-based contests
- _Self-Taught_ — Once per scene, reroll or redraw a failed knowledge-based check
- _Survivor_ — Improved outcomes when scavenging or enduring harsh environments

Backstory perks often:

- Apply broadly
- Trigger in environmental or social contexts
- Provide narrative leverage rather than raw power

---

### 2. Motivation-Based Perks (Card 2)

Motivation perks express **why the character acts** and how they push forward under pressure.

**Example Perks:**

- _Driven_ — Gain a bonus when pursuing stated goals tied to motivation
- _Vengeful_ — Increased effectiveness against a declared enemy or faction
- _Idealist_ — Social interactions favor honesty and moral arguments
- _Obsessive_ — Gain bonuses when focused, suffer penalties when distracted

Motivation perks frequently:

- Interact with engagement and story events
- Provide situational bonuses with narrative constraints
- Encourage role-consistent decision-making

---

### 3. Class / Archetype Perks (Card 3)

Class perks define **how the character solves problems**, not what they are allowed to attempt.

**Example Perks:**

- _Weapon Specialist_ — Enhanced outcomes with a chosen weapon type
- _Tactician_ — Improved positioning and coordination in group contests
- _Ritual Adept_ — Reduced cost or risk when casting prepared spells
- _Trickster_ — Advantage when using misdirection, feints, or deception

Class perks are often:

- Mechanically focused
- Synergistic with specific skills
- Central to the character’s role in the party

---

### 4. Race / Species Perks (Card 4)

Race perks reflect **biology, culture, or innate traits**, not power scaling.

**Example Perks:**

- _Darkvision_ — Improved perception in low-light conditions
- _Iron Constitution_ — Resistance to poison, disease, or exhaustion
- _Keen Senses_ — Increased detection range or clarity
- _Ancestral Memory_ — Access to forgotten knowledge or cultural lore

Race perks typically:

- Apply passively
- Modify environmental or sensory interactions
- Reinforce world-building and faction identity

---

### Design Intent

- Perks and traits are **layered modifiers**, not stat replacements
- Most perks are **situational**, not always-on
- Campaign designers control:
  - Which perks exist
  - How many are drawn
  - When they evolve or unlock

Perks are where **character identity becomes gameplay**.

---

## Perk Stacking & Progression

Perks represent distinct techniques, habits, or advantages. To keep the system lightweight, **perk stacking only occurs when the same
perk is gained more than once**, typically during perk draws.

There is no general stacking between different perks.

---

## Perk Stacking (Duplicate Perks Only)

If a character gains a perk they already have:

- The perk **stacks**
- Each duplicate increases the perk’s effectiveness
- Most perks support **up to 3 stacks** by default

Stacks are tracked as a simple count.

### Example

- _Lockbreaker_ (1 stack)  
  → +1 when resolving lock-related contests

- _Lockbreaker_ (2 stacks)  
  → +2 when resolving lock-related contests

- _Lockbreaker_ (3 stacks)  
  → +3

If a perk is drawn beyond its maximum stack limit, the GM or system may:

- Reroll the perk

---

## Individual Skill Progression – XP System

In this game, **characters do not increase their core skill values** (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Perception, Constitution).  
Instead, progression occurs **through skills and perks**, which improve as a character actively uses them during contests, checks, or
story-driven actions.

---

### How XP is Earned

- Each contest is associated with **one or more relevant skills**
- When a character **succeeds** in a skill-based contest, they earn XP for that specific skill
- XP may be:
  - Awarded as a **fixed amount per success**
  - Adjusted based on **contest difficulty**
  - Modified by **perks, affinity, or situational bonuses**

**Example:**

- A player picks a lock successfully:
  - Lockpicking skill → +50 XP
  - Perk effects applied normally
  - If multiple skills are relevant (e.g., Agility + Perception), XP may be split or awarded for both based on campaign rules

---

### Skill-Specific XP

- XP is **tied to the skill** that was relevant to the action
- Skills accumulate XP independently
- Skill XP thresholds can unlock:
  - Tier upgrades for skill-based perks
  - Access to new narrative options or engagement bonuses
- Core skills themselves (Strength, Agility, etc.) **remain static**; only perks and secondary skills improve

---

### Design Intent

- Keeps progression **narrative- and skill-focused**
- Avoids inflating base stats and breaking campaign balance
- Rewards players for using skills creatively and consistently
- Enables **tracking individual character growth** without affecting party XP or overall game scaling

---

### Optional Rules

Campaign designers may choose to:

- Track **partial XP for failed contests**
- Grant XP for **roleplay consistency**
- Adjust XP amounts based on **party level or contest stakes**
