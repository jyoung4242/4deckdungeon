## NPC Interactions

NPCs in **4 Deck Dungeon** are primarily **narrative-driven** entities. Unlike combat or traps, NPCs do not automatically trigger
structured encounters or card draws. Instead, NPC interactions are **scripted by the GM**, with optional contests used to gate
progression, rewards, or information when uncertainty or risk is desired.

This approach preserves narrative control while allowing the Contest System and Engagement Deck to be selectively applied.

---

## Core Design Principle

> **NPCs are not encounters by default.**  
> They become mechanical only when the GM chooses to introduce uncertainty.

Most NPC interactions should resolve through roleplay and scripted outcomes. Cards are only introduced when something is at stake.

---

## NPC Interaction Layers

NPCs are designed using three conceptual layers. Only the first is required.

---

### 1. Scripted Layer (Always Present)

This is the NPC’s default state and contains all guaranteed content.

**Examples**

- Dialogue
- Lore exposition
- Worldbuilding
- Quest offers
- Faction alignment
- Personality and tone

**Characteristics**

- No card draws
- No contests
- Deterministic outcomes

This layer ensures story continuity and prevents over-randomization.

---

### 2. Gated Layer (Optional)

The Gated Layer defines **optional content** that is not automatically revealed or granted.

The GM explicitly defines:

- What is gated (information, quest, item, access)
- What skill(s) apply
- What success unlocks
- What failure does

When a gate exists, the GM may resolve it using a **single contest**.

**Common Gated Content**

- Hidden lore
- Better rewards
- Restricted access
- NPC trust
- Secret quests
- Faction favor

Cards are only used if a gate is present.

---

### 3. Escalation Layer (Conditional)

Escalation defines what happens if:

- A contest fails
- The player pushes too far
- The NPC is threatened or offended

Escalation is **never automatic** and must be explicitly allowed by the GM.

**Possible Escalations**

- NPC withdrawal
- Reputation loss
- Alarm raised
- Quest lockout
- Combat encounter
- Long-term hostility

---

## NPC Contests (When Used)

NPC contests are **lightweight** and localized.

They differ from full encounters in that:

- There is no initiative phase
- No primary or secondary engagement draw
- The NPC reacts rather than acts

### Contest Flow

1. Player declares approach (persuasion, deception, intimidation, insight)
2. GM identifies any gated content
3. One contest is resolved
4. Outcome is applied immediately

---

### Common NPC Contest Skills

| Approach     | Typical Skills             |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Persuasion   | Intelligence, social perks |
| Deception    | Intelligence, Agility      |
| Intimidation | Strength, Presence         |
| Insight      | Perception                 |
| Bargaining   | Intelligence, resources    |

NPC resistance is determined narratively by:

- Importance of the NPC
- Story context
- Faction alignment
- Stakes of the request

NPCs do not require full stat blocks.

---

## Using the Engagement Deck with NPCs

The **Engagement Deck** should only be used for NPC interactions when:

- The interaction is high-stakes
- The NPC is hostile or unknown
- The GM wants tonal or narrative variability
- The interaction may escalate unpredictably

In these cases, the NPC interaction may be treated as a **full NPC Encounter**, using:

- Primary draw for tone and pressure
- Secondary draw for disposition and volatility

Most NPCs will never require this.

---

## Example NPC Design

### NPC: Village Elder

**Scripted Content**

- Explains village history
- Mentions recent disappearances
- Offers shelter

**Gated Content**

- Location of a hidden passage

**Gate Definition**

- Skill: Perception or Persuasion
- Success → Passage revealed
- Failure → Elder deflects politely

**Escalation**

- Repeated intimidation attempts may cause the Elder to alert guards

No Engagement Deck draw required.

## NPCs vs NPC Encounters

| Situation                  | Resolution       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Lore exposition            | Scripted         |
| Quest offer                | Scripted         |
| Asking for a favor         | Optional contest |
| Negotiation under pressure | NPC encounter    |
| Interrogation              | NPC encounter    |
| Merchant pricing           | Optional contest |
| Casual conversation        | Scripted         |

---

## GM Guidance

When designing NPCs, ask:

1. What information or rewards are guaranteed?
2. What should require effort or risk?
3. What happens if the player fails?
4. Can this escalate meaningfully?

Only uncertain outcomes should involve mechanics.

---

## Design Notes

- NPCs prioritize narrative clarity over randomness
- Cards introduce uncertainty, not dialogue
- Gated content keeps player agency intact
- This system scales cleanly to both tabletop and digital formats

NPC interactions are tools for storytelling first, mechanics second.
