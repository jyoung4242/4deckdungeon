## Overview

4 Deck Dungeon allows you to run a campaign using a card/deck-based approach to generate and resolve:

- Characters and NPCs
- Randomized encounters
- Challenges and contests
- Loot and items
- Scene-based exploration

It is designed to be modular, so each system can be used independently or together as part of a full campaign runner.
